# PasswordVault
This is a offline password manager which integrates Google Authenticator to add a additional layer of security.
Passwords will be encrypted with the AES-256 algorithm and saved in a database.
You can either open a pull request and build the jar by yourself while viewing the source code.
But there is also a download link for the compiled jar to start asap.

#Important notes:
1. This is the first version, so please give feedback!
2. Make sure to save your master password, as it is not recoverable. If you can't remember it, all saved passwords will be lost!
3. Don't delete the config.json or the databases! Either your passwords will be lost or you can't access them.
